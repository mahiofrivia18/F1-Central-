                <h2>Ferrari</h2>
                <p>
                    Ferrari, the most iconic name in motorsport, has been a cornerstone of Formula 1 since the very beginning. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1947, the Scuderia joined the F1 championship in 1950 and quickly cemented its status as a powerhouse. Ferrari’s blood-red cars, known as the "Prancing Horse," are synonymous with speed, prestige, and passion. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the decades, Ferrari has experienced both glorious highs and devastating lows. Drivers such as Alberto Ascari, Niki Lauda, and Michael Schumacher have delivered unforgettable moments, each etching their name into the annals of F1 history. Schumacher’s dominance in the early 2000s, where he secured five consecutive world championships, is a testament to Ferrari’s relentless pursuit of excellence. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Ferrari’s legacy extends beyond just statistics. Their passionate fanbase, known as the "Tifosi," is one of the most loyal and enthusiastic in the world. Every race weekend, you’ll find them draped in red, waving flags and cheering for their team through thick and thin. This connection with their fans has made Ferrari more than just a team—it’s a way of life for millions.

                    Under the guidance of team principal Christian Horner and with the technical genius of Adrian Newey, Red Bull achieved unparalleled success in the early 2010s. Between 2010 and 2013, Sebastian Vettel dominated the sport, winning four consecutive world championships and solidifying Red Bull’s reputation as the team to beat. Their innovative designs, particularly in the field of downforce, set them apart from their competitors.

                <p>
                    In recent years, Red Bull has reignited its rivalry with Mercedes, culminating in one of the most dramatic seasons in F1 history in 2021.

                    Beyond their on-track performance, Red Bull has also excelled in promoting young talent through their junior driver program. Many of today’s top drivers, including Verstappen, Daniel Ricciardo, and Pierre Gasly, owe their careers to Red Bull’s unwavering belief in nurturing the next generation. As the sport evolves, Red Bull continues to innovate, pushing the limits of what’s possible in pursuit of victory.
